# Sorting Time Comparison ðŸ•’

Welcome to Sorting Time Comparison, a C++ program designed to evaluate and compare the execution times of various sorting algorithms. This project aims to provide insights into the performance of Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort under different conditions.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms** - Includes implementations of five common sorting algorithms.
- **Performance Analysis** - Compare the execution times of the algorithms to determine which is most efficient under various scenarios.
- **Detailed Output** - Provides execution times in a readable format, allowing for easy analysis and comparison.
- **Customizable Data Sets** - Users can input their own data sets to see how each algorithm performs with different types of data.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. This program is compatible with compilers that support C++11 or later.

```bash```
# Example for checking GCC version
g++ --version

Usage ðŸ“š
Run the program following the compilation to see the execution times of each sorting algorithm. You can modify the input data in the source code to test different data scenarios and analyze the performance across diverse conditions.
